### Project Motivation<a name="project_motivation"></a>

Exploratory data analysis of wildfire in California from a dataset that contains 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire occurred in United States from 1992 to 2015.

1. What are the most fire-prone counties in California? 

2. What is the distribution of fire size classes? 

3. What is the distribution of stated causes of fire? 

4. Can we predict the stated causes of fire? 


which counties are the most and least fire-prone in the state of California, the distribution of stated causes of wildfire, and to predict the cause of wildfires from ten selected features using decision tree classifier method. It is found that the most and least fire-prone counties in California are Riverside and Douglas, respectively. The most stated cause of wildfire is ‘Miscellaneous’ and the least stated cause of wildfire is ‘Structure’.
